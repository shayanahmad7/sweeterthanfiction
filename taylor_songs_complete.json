Please tell me\n'Cause one second it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said \"forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest made you run and hide?\nLike a scared little boy\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said \"forever and always\"\nAnd it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nI don't think so\nOh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nPlease back up, oh back up\nBack up, baby, back up\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said \"forever and always\"\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\nYou didn't mean it baby\nYou said \"forever and always\", yeah"

down\nIt must have been her fault his heart gave out\nAnd they said\n\"There goes the last great American dynasty\nWho knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\nThere goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\"\nRebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever\nFlew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city\nFilled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names\nAnd blew through the money on the boys and the ballet\nAnd losing on card game bets with Dalí\nAnd they said\n\"There goes the last great American dynasty\nWho knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\nThere goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen\nShe had a marvelous time ruining everything\"\nThey say she was seen on occasion\nPacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea\nAnd in a feud with her neighbor\nShe stole his dog and dyed it key lime green\nFifty years is a long time\nHoliday House sat quietly on that beach\nFree of women with madness, their men and bad habits\nAnd then it was bought by me\nWho knows, if I never showed up, what could've been\nThere goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen\nI had a marvelous time ruining everything\nI had a marvelous time ruining everything\nA marvelous time ruining everything\nA marvelous time\nI had a marvelous time"

Will you love me?\nWill you kiss me on the porch\nIn front of all your stupid friends?\nIf you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\nWill it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissin' in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight\nYou know I miss you"

I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\"\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Is it okay? Is it you?\nOr have they come to take me away?\nTo take me away\nOh my, love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\nIt hits different (It hits different), it hits different this time\nCatastrophic blues\nMoving on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different (It hits different), it hits different 'cause it's you\nOh my, love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by (It hits different 'cause it's you)\n('Cause it's you)\nCatastrophic blues\nMoving on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different, it hits different 'cause it's you, yeah"

    "lyric": "You had people who called you on unmarked numbers\nIn my peripheral vision\nI let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer\nAll was quickly forgiven\nYou were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious\nFlush with the currency of cool\nI was always turnin' out my empty pockets\nAnd when it came to you\nI didn't come here to make friends\nWe were born to be suburban legends\nWhen you hold me, it holds me together\nAnd you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\nI had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs\nWould surprise the whole school\nWhen I ended up back at our class reunion\nWalkin' in with you\nYou'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries\nWith the pages ripped out\nI am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium\nAnd I can still see you now\nI didn't come here to make friends\nWe were born to be suburban legends\nWhen you hold me, it holds me together\nAnd you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\nI know that you still remember\nWe were born to be national treasures\nWhen you told me we'd get back together\nAnd you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\nTick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block\nI broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\nWaves crash on the shore, I dash to the door\nYou don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined\nTick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block\nI broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\nWaves crash to the shore, I dash to the door\nYou don't knock anymore and I always knew it\nThat my life would be ruined"
